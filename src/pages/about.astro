  <p>
    Hey! I'm a junior software engineer who loves designing reliable systems and shipping products that feel great to use.
  </p>
  <p>
    I work across the stack with TypeScript, React/Next.js and Vue/Nuxt.js. I care deeply about readable code,
    strong tests, and observability. My approach: ship small, iterate quickly, measure outcomes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recent highlights include the implementation of a rule editor with the VueFlow plugin 
    and integration with APIs with preview environments and quality controls.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of my work on features, I enjoy mentoring, documenting, and creating design system components that enable easy and fast collaboration with the team.
Always learning, I am always excited to collaborate on important problems.
  </p>
